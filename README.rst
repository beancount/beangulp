beangulp: Importers Framework for Beancount
-------------------------------------------

``beangulp`` provides a framework for importing transactions into a
Beancount ledger from account statements and other documents and for
managing documents.

``beangulp`` is compatible with both Beancount 2.3 and the
Beancount 3.0. ``beangulp`` is the evolution of ``beancount.ingest`` in
Beancount 2.3 and replaces it in the Beancount 3.0 release.

Documentation is available in form of code docstrings and
`examples`__.  The `documentation`__ for ``beancount.ingest`` provided
a good introduction and is still partially relevant to ``beangulp``.
The rest of the Beancount documentation can be found `here`__.
