# beangulp: Importers Framework for Beancount

## Overview

This is the official repository for the importers framework for Beancount. This
library defines a workflow that helps you build importers for your various
accounts and provides utilities that work with them. It should work with the
latest version of Beancount v2 and v3.

## Status

As of February 2021, the project has just been forked out of Beancount.
Expect some changes to be made here.
See this document for plans:

## History

This project is the continuation of the LedgerHub project, which was later on
folded within Beancount as `beancount.ingest`. It has now been separated out
again in order to allow other contributors to more easily contribute and to keep
the core of Beancount simpler and leaner. The rationale for this change can be
read here:

## Documentation

The previous version documentation is available here and must be updated:
