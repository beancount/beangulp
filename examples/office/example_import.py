"""Alternative import configuration as Python script.

Instead of running the bean-identify, bean-extract and bean-file tools, you can
instead write a single Python script and call
beangulp.scripts_utils.ingest(). Calling this function invokes a script
runner that accepts one of three subcommands: identify, extract or file,
corresponding to the bean-identify, bean-extract and bean-file programs.

Calling the runner yourself from Python also allows you to provide filter
functions, or "hooks" to post-process the list of extracted entities. We've put
an example below that doesn't do much, but you could do various things, e.g.
make your own heuristic to detect duplicate entries, merge entries from multiple
files, reorder the entries in your favorite order, clean up your payee names,
add some metadata, etc. These hooks run on the final output and independently of
the importers.

Note that this script is otherwise identical to the "example.import" file in
this directory.
